/*
This file exists to quickly set up a scene to be
rendered by the program. The actual parsing of this file
is quite lenient, so the relative ordering of statements
can generally be modified. This comes with some exceptions:
	1. The size statement must come before the camera
		declaration, as the camera needs dimensions to be
		properly initialized.
	2. The materials section must come before the scene
		section, as the materials designated to be used
		must be declared beforehand.
As with most parsed languages, blank lines are ignored.
Comments can be written using a double slash ("//"),
however this is only strictly enforced within the materials
and scene sections as the statements within require specific
names to be parsed correctly. Outside of these sections,
anything that does not match a meaningful statement will be
ignored.
